				<p>un|fold is a multidimensional light and sound sculpture, created for the historic Turbine Hall at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology, as part of the <a href="https://nobelweeklights.se/?lang=en">Nobel Week Lights 2022</a>. It contrasts the simplicity of digital actions that can be used to explain complex chemical processes with the actual complexity and intricacies of the software traces that perform these actions.

				<h3> Context </h3>
				<p>In 2020, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to E. Charpentier and J. Doudna <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2020/summary/">“for the development
					of a method for genome editing.”</a> One way of explaining genome editing is to liken it to editing in a text
					document, specifically to “search and replace”, since the key to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR">CRISPR</a> technology is the ability to
					identify and replace a part of the DNA. While the processes that enable the CRISPR search and replace
					action on genomes are extremely sophisticated, people draw parallels with text editing as a simple analogy
					in order to make the complex chemistry more accessible.
				</p>
				<p>A search and replace operation in a text editor is appropriate to illustrate the complexity of CRISPR with
					a mundane digital operation that is easier to grasp than the intricate chemical processes involved in DNA
					engineering. It is fascinating to notice that, in contrast to this apparent simplicity, the software processes
					involved in a search and replace are intricate and complex. Even what we perceive as the simplest digital
					sections is an invisible and intangible set of processes that run millions of operations per second, on top of
					world-wide networks. With this software art installation, called un|fold, we wish to draw attention to the
					hidden yet impressive and beautiful complexity that lies below the most basic digital actions. Our goal is to
					create appreciation and interest in the intricate layers of code involved in the actions of search and replace,
					through a multidimensional light and sound sculpture.
				</p>

				<h3> The installation </h3>
				<p>un|fold enchants visitors with a large 3D LED sculpture that
					occupies the whole space in the turbine hall. The pulse of the light sculpture conveys the depth of the code
					layers that unfold when we search and replace text in an editor. The layers are composed of long streams of operations, as
					well as of different parts that have been created by various organizations, and put together by the creators
					of the text editor.
				</p>
				<p>un|fold is composed of three layers:
					<ul>
						<li>An LED sculpture in which the trace of the calls and methods
							triggered by the search and replace action are mapped and animated in three dimensional space. The
							sculpture is installed inside the turbine hall, to be observed through the window.</li>
						<li>An animated projection
							mapped on individual window panels which communicates the context and serves as the "surface" or "screen"
							behind which the complexity happens.</li>
						<li>A sound work conveying the data and producing an immersive
							atmosphere that draws in the audience.</li>
					</ul>
