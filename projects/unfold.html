				<p>un|fold is a multidimensional light and sound sculpture, created for the historic Turbine Hall at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology, as part of the <a href="https://nobelweeklights.se/?lang=en">Nobel Week Lights 2022</a>. It contrasts the simplicity of digital actions that can be used to explain complex chemical processes with the actual complexity and intricacies of the software traces that perform these actions.

				<h3> Context </h3>
				<p>In 2020, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to E. Charpentier and J. Doudna <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2020/summary/">“for the development
					of a method for genome editing.”</a> One way of explaining genome editing is to liken it to editing in a text
					document, specifically to “search and replace”, since the key to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR">CRISPR</a> technology is the ability to
					identify and replace a part of the DNA. While the processes that enable the CRISPR search and replace
					action on genomes are extremely sophisticated, people draw parallels with text editing as a simple analogy
					in order to make the complex chemistry more accessible.
				</p>
				<p>A search and replace operation in a text editor is appropriate to illustrate the complexity of CRISPR with
					a mundane digital operation that is easier to grasp than the intricate chemical processes involved in DNA
					engineering. It is fascinating to notice that, in contrast to this apparent simplicity, the software processes
					involved in a search and replace are intricate and complex. Even what we perceive as the simplest digital
					sections is an invisible and intangible set of processes that run millions of operations per second, on top of
					world-wide networks. With this software art installation, called un|fold, we wish to draw attention to the
					hidden yet impressive and beautiful complexity that lies below the most basic digital actions. Our goal is to
					create appreciation and interest in the intricate layers of code involved in the actions of search and replace,
					through a multidimensional light and sound sculpture.

			<!-- 	<p>un|fold enchants visitors with a large 3D LED sculpture that -->

			<!-- 	</p> -->
			<!-- 	<p>un|fold is composed of three layers: -->
			<!-- 		<ul> -->
			<!-- 			<li>An LED sculpture in which the trace of the calls and methods -->
			<!-- 				triggered by the search and replace action are mapped and animated in three dimensional space. The -->
			<!-- 				sculpture is installed inside the turbine hall, to be observed through the window.</li> -->
			<!-- 			<li>An animated projection -->
			<!-- 				mapped on individual window panels which communicates the context and serves as the "surface" or "screen" -->

				<h3> The installation </h3>
				<p>un|fold’s lights and sound are algorithmically generated based on data. The data is the recording of all software operations that are performed by a text editor when a human user performs the following task: search for “Hello there” and replace it by “Hi there”. For this artwork, we record the function calls performed in a Java virtual machine. un|fold then plays back the sequence of functions at a constant speed of 25ms per event, mapping them to a LED and sound artwork. The quasi instantaneous search and replace software is turned into a 2h30 multimedia piece, letting the audience appreciate the sublime nature of the invisible digital world that’s around us.
				</p>
				<p> un|fold unveils one specific aspect of software’s nature: modern software is built in layers upon layers through decades of work by many, often practically anonymous, individuals. Programmers of new software rely on collections of code written by others, which in turn relies on code written by others, and so on. These layers are referred to as the software supply chain.</p>
				<p>In un|fold, we reveal the deep software supply chain of search and replace, LEDs  referencing how far away we are from the code written especially for that action, and sound reflecting on the diversity of sections of code.</p>
				<p><h4>data <-> sculpture</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>The more LEDs light up, the further away we are into the layers of software dependencies.</li>
						<li>The color of a row of LEDs corresponds to different dependencies, and therefore different programmers contributing to the functioning of the software.</li>
						<li>The brighter the timbre of the sound is, the more diverse that section of software activity.</li>
						<li>The movement of pitch in the sonification directly maps to the movement of the computer through the software structures.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<p><h4>Window projections</h4>
					Around the LED sculpture, six live-generated animations are projected on the windows, three on each side. They visualize the above-mentioned data in different ways, thus enriching the experience, providing more context and exploring the software/biology metaphors.
				</p>
