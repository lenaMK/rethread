                willing to engage with the larger conversation of the theme of the exhibition and work together with
                re|thread to enable the creation of the extended “credits” for their work.

            <p>

                This entails providing a list of the software used in the creation of the work, as well as the answering
                questions regarding other (artistic, technical, social, philosophical etc.) inspiration and key
                contributions to the work in written or interview format.

            <p>
                Decisions about selection will be made by the project group and cannot be appealed.
