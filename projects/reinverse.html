				<p>[re|in]verse is a light, sound and water installation that reveals the extraordinary software layers involved in the core matrix operations
					that power the scientific work of Nobel laureates and their teams. The installation is made of light and
					sound patterns that reflect on the amount of computation, data, as well as on the speed of the software
					involved. The patterns generated are based on various matrix operations that are often used in scientific research.

				<h3> Context </h3>
				<p>
					In 1932, Werner Heisenberg was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for modeling quantum mechanics, then an emerging field of research, using matrices, which are powerful mathematical tools. Living in a pre-computer world, Heisenberg would calculate and manipulate matrices by hand, with pen and paper.
					In our day and age, quantum mechanics researchers still work with these matrices and continue Heisenberg's work, but with computers. It may appear simpler, but thousands of software operations are happening very quickly behind each push of a key. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Throughout the last decades, several Nobel laureates have heavily relied on image analysis, pattern recognition and predictive modeling. In all of these mathematical and software tools, the notion of matrix is a central part. It is the core structure
					to organize, analyse, store, exchange, transform and make sense of complex data retrieved from the physical
					world. The matrices used in science are very large arrays that contain millions to billions of numbers that
					capture fractions of our physical environment. The software packages that manipulate these matrices must
					be mathematically correct, as well as efficient in order to support the analysis of gigantic amounts of data
					in a reasonable time. This is why several software tools have emerged, each of them dedicated to matrices
					of different sizes, shapes and content. The quest for efficiency has motivated recent advances in machine
					learning for matrix computation.

				<h3> The installation </h3>
					<p>
						[re|in]verse is a light, sound and water work placed in the underpass under Centralbron. It animates matrices by projecting light beams onto the closest pillars, thus representing the data as a new matrix.
					</p>
				<h3> Matrices all the way down </h3>
					<p>
						Matrices are found on different levels of the installation. The data, that is visualized and sonified, is the software execution trace of different matrix operations (multiplication, singular value decomposition, normaliziation, inversion, Hessenberg decomposition). The matrices used to make these operations were randomly generated, and can be either completely random, diagonal, upper/lower triangular, Vandermonde. They are all invertible and their dimensions are 32 x 32 (in reference to 1932, the year in which Heisenberg was awarded the Nobel Prize).

				<h3> Music </h3>
					<h4> Time and time signatures </h4>
						<p>
							The overall form of the piece is a 2 + 1 (60s movement +  30s "break")
							form, which mirrors the most common form in the software. Some
							operations are further subdivided in three and some in 4 with a
							recurring 1 + 2 + 1 pattern. The music reflects this by the amplitude of
							pulses and how often chords are changed.
						</p>
						<p>
							Each block of activity in the software execution generally contains 32
							"beats", or iterations, coinciding with the dimensionality of the
							matrix. Similarly, every movement in the music has 32 pulses.
						</p>
						<p>
							A very common feature in the software execution is an accellerando, as
							iterations work on smaller and smaller subsections of the matrix. The
							music reflects this through the modulation of sine waves in the "break"
							part.

					<h4> Harmony </h4>
						<p>
							Like the 32 rows and columns of the matrices we have been experimenting
							on, the harmony of the piece consists of 32 chords. The tuning system
							used is 53-EDO and the chords, in ups and downs notation, are Cv7, C^m7,
							CvM9 and Csus24, transposed a fifth up eight times. To determine the
							next chord, a matrix in the current operation is used as an adjacency
							matrix, interpreted as the probability of moving to any of the other
							chords from the current chord. To illustrate passing from source matrix
							to the result of the operation performed, the source matrix is used as
							the adjacency matrix in the first two thirds of a movement and the
							resulting matrix in the last third.
						</p>
					<h4> Melody </h4>
						<p>
							Some of the least used machine instructions in the trace are turned into
							a melody. Depending on its rarity, the instructions is assigned a pitch
							and, working our way through a small portion of the trace, we allow each
							instruction to take some times, whether it is played or not. The machine
							instructions are treated as a score, of which we play only one part out
							of many. As any human interpreter, our machine musician freely adds its
							own inflection and ornamentation to ameliorate the music.
						</p>
					<h4> Audification </h4>
						<p>
							Anything that is data can be turned into sound by simply reinterpreting
							the numbers as digital audio; a process called audification. The
							audification of the actual traces machine code instructions can be heard
							as the wave like spacey chords in the background and the high noisy
							flute like drone in the break section.
