				<p>[re|in]verse is a light, sound and water installation that reveals the extraordinary software layers involved in the core matrix operations
					that power the scientific work of Nobel laureates and their teams. The installation is made of light and
					sound patterns that reflect on the amount of computation, data, as well as on the speed of the software
					involved. The patterns generated are based on various matrix operations that are often used in scientific research.

				<h3> Context </h3>
				<p>
					In 1932, Werner Heisenberg was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for modeling quantum mechanics, then an emerging field of research, using matrices, which are powerful mathematical tools. Living in a pre-computer world, Heisenberg would calculate and manipulate matrices by hand, with pen and paper.
					In our day and age, quantum mechanics researchers still work with these matrices and continue Heisenberg's work, but with computers. It may appear simpler, but thousands of software operations are happening very quickly behind each push of a key. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Throughout the last decades, several Nobel laureates have heavily relied on image analysis, pattern recognition and predictive modeling. In all of these mathematical and software tools, the notion of matrix is a central part. It is the core structure
					to organize, analyse, store, exchange, transform and make sense of complex data retrieved from the physical
					world. The matrices used in science are very large arrays that contain millions to billions of numbers that
					capture fractions of our physical environment. The software packages that manipulate these matrices must
					be mathematically correct, as well as efficient in order to support the analysis of gigantic amounts of data
					in a reasonable time. This is why several software tools have emerged, each of them dedicated to matrices
					of different sizes, shapes and content. The quest for efficiency has motivated recent advances in machine
					learning for matrix computation.

				<h3> The installation </h3>
				<p>[re|in]verse is a light, sound and water work placed in the underpass under Centralbron. It animates matrices by projecting light beams onto the closest 16 pillars (4 rows of 4 pillars), thus representing the data as a new 4-by-4 matrix.</p>
