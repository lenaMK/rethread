                    <p>Search engines</p>
                    <p>We use them every day for all sorts of occupations. From education and information to
                    entertainment.
                    Search engines are deeply integrated in our digital life.
                    We trust them. We rely on them. We know them.</p>
                    <p> This online exhibition lets you discover the intricate strata of code and network that operate to
                        deliver the content of a web search.
                        Drift reveals how these strata continuously evolve, even behind what seems a very well
                        known, stable, familiar web site.</p>
                    </p>
                    <p>While you visit Drift, you will discover the teeming world of code and complex networks
                        that keep evolving to deliver the content of eight search engines. Evolution is powered by the
                        constant
                        work of software development teams, that continuously improve performance, security and user
                        experience.</p>
                    <p>Drift lets you interactively explore the strata of 8 search engines that have been captured every
                        hour over a period of
                        two months in May and June 2020. You can explore evolution step by step or let time evolve at
                        normal or ludicrous speed.
                        You can explore the relative pace of evolution among strata and between two different web sites.
