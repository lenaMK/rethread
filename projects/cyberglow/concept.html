                        Software is <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460">eating the world</a>! It is <a href="https://www.wired.com/2013/11/software-is-reorganizing-the-world-and-cloud-formations-could-lead-to-physical-nations/">reorganizing the World</a>! Software <a href="https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/software-takes-command-9781623567453/">takes command</a>. 
                        These strong claims by tech leaders and scholars highlight the spectacular presence of software in all aspects of our lives. They are also calls for citizens to be aware of this spectacular software presence. 
                        <a href="https://rethread.art/">re|thread</a> is an art and software collective striving to let citizens make sense of software through artistic media. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_art">Software art</a>, an art discipline that boomed in the early 2000s, remains as relevant as ever. Through software art, we wish to unveil software to the general public via artistic and emotional channels, stimulating a deep understanding of one of the fabrics of society directly through their senses.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Software is the core medium that fuels our digital society, providing services to citizens,
					governments, activists and corporations. It is an invisible and intangible set of processes that run
					millions of operations per second, on top of world-wide networks. With cyber|glow, we wished to unveil
					these invisible processes and give the audience a sense of the extraordinary scale of software that
					surrounds them.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        cyber|glow is a light installation, generated in real time based on software events from a custom made game played by the audience. The multiplayer game is projected for the audience to play on their smartphones and the software powering the game is traced in real time. These software traces are mapped onto laser movements, revealing both the obvious and the hidden software events happening underneath the surface.

                            The cyber|glow web-based game was designed to fit the theme of the festival, teaching the audience about the scientific discoveries of some selected Nobel laureates. It also let the audience's own devices become an integrated part of the installation, without the need to install custom apps. Making our own game allowed us access to the entire software infrastructure: the software events in the game and on the computers making the game possible.

                            In cyber|glow, we reveal four layers of software: 1) the communication between the different parts of the software stack: the player's phone, the web server and the computer generating the visuals; 2) the software events directly visible to the players, such as selecting a character, moving around or answering a question; 3) the server side software events happening in the background; and 4) the deep, almost unimaginably numerous, software events happening in the very core of the operating system while producing the laser and web based game visuals.

                            It is the actions of the audience that trigger the game play activity of the piece. By engaging with the interactive part of the work, the audience incorporates their own devices in the experience. We have grown attached to our smart devices and engaging with them....

                            Aside from the technical aspect of triggering events within the game, the work provided a social experience of playing a digital multiplayer game with strangers, where all players were in the same physical space. We observed that separate groups of players were connected both through the in-game social features and in the real worl physical space.


                            The audience triggers all activity in the work, and
                            - The audience learns something about software
                            - Without the audience, nothing happens
                            - Triggering social interaction, multiplayer game in one place
