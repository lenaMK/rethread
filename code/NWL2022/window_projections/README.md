# Window projections

This folder contains the code to generate the window visualizations. 

There are two versions, which are given as URL parameters. The key is ``where`` and the possible values are ``left`` and ``right``: 
- [``https://rethread.art/code/NWL2022/window_projections/multi/?where=left``](https://rethread.art/code/NWL2022/window_projections/multi/?where=left),
- [``https://rethread.art/code/NWL2022/window_projections/multi/?where=right``](https://rethread.art/code/NWL2022/window_projections/multi/?where=right).

The files can also be loaded locally, internet connection is not required. If the animations do not fit the screen correctly (for example, after setting them in full screen), reload the page and it will be fixed automatically. Press the space bar to show or hide the lines separating the three animations in each projection.

The [``individual``](individual) forder contains work-in-progress versions.
