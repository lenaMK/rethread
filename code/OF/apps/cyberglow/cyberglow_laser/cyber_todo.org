Sometimes

** Try changing cables and network equipment to see if that's the issue

* DONE Text

Text is quite hard to read, partly because it is flickering unless very imprecise.

It is easier to read text drawn a few letters at a time.

** DONE Implement functions for drawing a text message over time, a few letters at a time

** DONE All the letters

* Optimisations

** Limit the number of user event texts
*** DONE Check the maximum number of text messages possible
** TODO Player trail flickering
** DONE Add off time on laser text for the zoomed out view

* DONE Activity points

** DONE Limit number of activity points to improve speed
If there are too many points already, maybe some points can merge into one bigger point?

** DONE Draw activity points as points
Drawing points instead of circles is waaaay faster.

* User views
** DONE Fix user move coordinate
** DONE Show all user events separately

* Ftrace visualisations

** DONE Many very short dots, one long dot in the middle

** DONE Colour code error codes

** DONE Something rising from the bottom up
System calls
Some analysis (process? type?)

** TODO Walk across the screen
Similar types of events start close to each other
small subset of types

** ftrace event types

*** prefixes
ys, dd, ix, cp, redit, random,

There is probably one letter missing from the parsing in many of these
- ys: sys
- cp: tcp
- dd: add? (mostly random events)
- ix: irq_matrix
- redit: credit (random event)

* DONE Transitions between states

# ** TODO Fly into one of the circles of the triangle
Maybe spin around at the end to reveal like the inside?

Looks good on the laser!! I need to fix the issue with zooming into/out of a specific spot.

** DONE Spin around to switch between states for the same position

** DONE Automatic transitions

* DONE Automatically connect and arm laser on startup

** DONE Find Etherdream automatically
This is the only part left, try it with the box.

* View ideas

** DONE Let scrolling text from events fly across the screen

** TODO More details about the architecture in the zoomed out view
More details could be optionally drawn on the same view
- Different connected users (who have made an action in the last n seconds)
- Different parts of the server structure
- Different parts that are in the room (laser, DAC, webcams, server, projector)

** NO Rain of ftrace events
Different colours for different events
Tested: doesn't work, the laer doesn't have time to draw them and the colours don't work with low intensity dots.

** HOLD Stack trace like view?

** HOLD Heartbeat monitor for events

** DONE User view for events per user

** DONE One colour per source of data
- users
- server
- room and OS

** DONE More events in the web server view

** DONE Server lines
- full line turning on per event, or
- a dot running horizontally


* Documentation

** DONE Pause function for creating stills
- don't run update
- don't accept new events

* Knowledge Base

** Dot intensity
It seems like the maximum dot intensity is approximately 1.0 / (number_of_dots * 4)

* From test

** DONE Disable vis being transitioned from because it becomes too bright when it's tiny

** Try to get rid of the flickering
- many users on red dots
- web ser er circle?
