Welcome to sys|calls, an audiovisual live performance by re|thread and Jaime Reyes!

First some safety information. In the event of a fire alarm, immediately but calmly exit the building the way you came in, or through the opening on the other side of the room and down the stairs. There will be flashing lights and sudden sounds.

Feel free to take photos, but please refrain from using a flash.

System calls are tiny exchanges between a computer program and the operating system, bringing information and little gifts back and forth. Tonight's performer will perform computer work: editing text documents, checking system stats, browsing the internet and checking his email. Throughout the last few weeks and months, Jaime has crafted real time visuals and I have composed a bespoke interactive virtual sound object to transform these system calls into the light streams and sound paintings you will soon experience.

I'm Erik Natanael. With me in the booth is Jaime Reyes. Behind the scenes are Maria Kling and Benoit Baudry. Working the computer tonight is Roni Kaufman.

The performance will begin shortly. Please enjoy!
