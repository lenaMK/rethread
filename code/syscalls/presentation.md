Welcome to sys|calls, an audiovisual exploration of software minutiae by re|thread and Jaime Reyes!

System calls are tiny exchanges between a computer program and the operating system, bringing information and little gifts back and forth. Our computer performer will perform computer work: editing text documents, checking system stats, browsing the internet and checking his email. Throughout the last few weeks and months, Jaime has crafted real time visuals and I have composed a bespoke interactive virtual sound object to transform these system calls into the light streams and sound paintings you will soon experience.

The performance will begin shortly. Please enjoy!

I'm Erik Natanael. With me in the booth is Jaime Reyes. Behind the scenes are Maria Kling and Benoit Baudry. Working the computer tonight is Roni Kaufman.
