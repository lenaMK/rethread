### Frame 1
Search engines

### Frame 2
We use them all the time, 
every day, 
for all sorts of tasks
information, (google bar)
education, (wikipedia bar)
entertainment (spotify bar)

We trust them (qwant bar)
We rely on them (bing bar)
We know them (google bar)

### Frame 14
Do we? (zoom / anonymous bar)

### Frame 3
How do they work?
Do they ever change?
Why did this new icon appear recently?
Where is this new color coming from?
Why is it slower than yesterday

Well….

### Frame 15
it’s because a search engine is not only a page with results (screenshot)
it’s a program
made of code (code appears)
made of complex operations (trace appears)
made of world-wide connection (networks appears)
[ADD] All of this seamless to the user

### Frame 6
Drift captures the aesthetics of each of these layers (the drift home page)
What you see, and (screenshot)
The code, the search engine’s organism (code → abstract image)
The complex operations, the nervous system  (trace → abstract image)
The world-wide connections, the deep underworld (network → image)

### frame 8
Drift let’s you experiment how all layers keep on evolving in time, all the time, every hour

With any search engine, as user, you might think that the page is always the same (wikipidia fullscreeen with time passing)
But, all around the world, software development teams keep on 
changing the underlying code (code appears)
to experiment with new features, to fix bugs, (switch to trace)
to improve user experience, to push search to ludicrous speed (switch to network)

### Frame 9
Visiting Drift, you can explore the layers of eight search engines that were recorded every hour, from XXX to YYYY
_questions combined with explanation of the interactions_

### Frame 10
Do you want to know more about the exhibition, the layers, the artists, the bot or spaceballs?
Come meet us (with screencast of ‘meet the artists’)

### Frame 11
_conclusion_
