### Frame 1
Search engines

### Frame 2
We use them all the time, 
every day, 
for all sorts of tasks
information, (google bar)
entertainment (spotify bar)
education, (wikipedia bar)


We trust them (qwant bar)
We rely on them (bing bar)
We know them (google bar)

### Frame 14
Do we? (zoom / anonymous bar) [Note: introduce doubt in the listeners mind. Also pause, slow or But...]

### Frame 3
     
Is your favourite search engine always the same?
Why did this new icon appear recently?
Where is this new color coming from?
Why is it slower than yesterday

Well….

### Frame 15
it’s because a search engine is not only a page with results (screenshot)
it’s a program  
made of millions of lines of code (code appears) 
made of thousands of interconected operations (trace appears)
made of world-wide connection (networks appears) ---slow down vo ice
[ADD] 

### Frame 6
Drift is a digital exhibition that lets you interact with four layers of search engines
It captures the aesthetics of each layer (the drift home page)
What you usually see as well as the invisible (screenshot)
The code, the search engine’s organism (code → abstract image)
The complex operations, the nervous system  (trace → abstract image)
The world-wide connections, the deep underworld (network → image)

### frame 8
Drift let’s you dive into search engines. It reveals [ACTION CLICK PLAY TIMELINE] how the invisible layers keep on evolving in time, all the time [HIGHLIGHT TIME], every hour 


### Frame 9
In Drift you can explore the layers of eight search engines that were recorded every hour, from XXX to YYYY

###
Discover the engine with most code
or less code

Find the engine with most calls to other computers

or least changes in the results

or even compare them...
with ludicrous speed!

### Frame 10
Do you want to know more about the exhibition, the layers, the artists, the bot or spaceballs?
Come meet us (with screencast of ‘meet the artists’)
