# Instruction types

Sine waves triggered when an instruction pops up in the trace. 
- Works will with one or two instructions with short sines for a little bit of texture on the note
- With many different instructions, longer sines and a slower tempo is better. Also, harmonic changes help.
- Reverb!

- Spela upp dem med neodljudsyntesen.

# Time and time signatures

The overall form of the piece is a 2 + 1 (60s movement +  30s "break") form, which mirrors the most common form in the software. Some operations are further subdivided in three and some in 4 with a recurring 1+2+1 pattern. The music reflects this by the amplitude of pulses and how often chords are changed.

Each block of activity in the software execusion generally contains 32 "beats", or iterations, coinciding with the dimensionality of the matrix. Similarly, every movement in the music has 32 pulses.

A very common feature in the software execution is an accellerando, as iterations work on smaller and smaller subsections of the matrix. The music reflects this through the modulation of sine waves in the "break" part.


## Multiply

Storform approx 2+1
First part has a repeating pattern in 4/4 1+2+1 with accelerando to the second part.
Second part has no such clear structure, but it is steadily doing a ritardando.

## SVD

Same pattern as Multiply


## Normalize

Very short, just init burst and then a slightly longer burst of noise.

## Inverse

Init burst
3 longer sections, the first slightly shorter.

## Hesseberg

Varies based on the source matrix.

### Diagonal 3
Instead of an accelerando, a ritardando over the entire trace. 1 long section only, apart from the init burst.

### Random 3
4+4+7
