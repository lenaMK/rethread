# de|code

[de|code](https://rethread.art/code/decode/) is a small project exploring the following questions:
- Could code formatting be an artistic practice? 
- What is pretty code?
- What is readable code?
- What is code?
- Is code poetry?

The falling code animation was inspired by Andreas Gysin's works (https://www.instagram.com/p/CUR2We3gc2I/).
