          <h2>Short description</h2>
<p>micro | traces is an audiovisual installation that scales software time down to human perception, to let visitors experience the scale shift that exists between the time of computers and the time of human senses.</p>

<p>One second of software activity in the software core of a laptop idle or learning is slowed down by a factor of 170 000 and displayed in three ways: a) sonically, projected into the room, b) as a live graph showing the current progress, projected on the wall by the speakers, and c) as a printed textual copy of all the events in human readable format, presented on bookstands.</p>

<p>As computers have gotten faster, the scale of their operations have moved further and further outside the limits of human perception. High frequency combined with human creativity formalized into source code supports the emergence of incredibly sophisticated processes, such as the instantaneous world-wide communication, or varied forms of artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>micro | traces builds on the software art tradition and the computational sublime to use recorded software activity as raw material.</p>

  <h2 class="c6" id="h.5wsfvzkrrrab"><span class="c13">How does your proposal respond to the theme of the open call?
      </span></h2>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c0">micro | traces explores the question &quot;How might micro scales that operate outside
      of human perception transform and construct new representations of society, culture, and the environment?&quot; by
      expanding and providing human access to one second of core software activity.</span></p>
  <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The time of computers is remotely related to the time of humans. In 1945, the first
      computer, a.k.a ENIAC, performed 500 floating point instructions per second. This was a frequency of computation
      out of human reach. Since 1945, the speed of computers has not ceased to increase. In 2022, the most simplest
      smartphone performs millions of operations per second, and supercomputers perform trillions of operations.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c0">As computers have gotten faster, the scale of their operations have moved further and
      further outside the limits of human perception. High frequency combined with human creativity formalised into
      source code supports the emergence of incredibly sophisticated processes, such as the instantaneous world-wide
      communication, or varied forms of artificial intelligence. Software, the fluid execution of source code [McLean02]
      on blazingly fast computers, is intangible and not accessible to direct human perception. While the smartphone is
      empowering millions of people to instantly find knowledge, communication and escapism, software is taking command
      [Manovich08], hidden behind the fundamental inaccessibility of computer operations.</span></p>
  <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Software art [Cramer 01] has explored this computational sublime [McCormack01] in the
      last two decades, through various new media. Among the artworks grounded into software, micro | traces is
      particularly inspired by the work of Ryoji Ikeda. Ikeda has explored the high frequencies of computers, code and
      the fluidity of executions with his series of work entitled Continuum [Ikeda18]. These installations immerse the
      visitor into large-scale audiovisual installations that physically convey the unthinkable speeds at which data
      collaborate computers to let software emerge. </span></p>
  <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c0">micro | traces dramatically slows computer time to let visitors feel the microscopic
      operations of modern software. Turning 1 second of software into 47 hours, each individual software operation
      becomes accessible to human senses. This 170 000 times slow down makes micro | traces an &quot;exploration&quot;
      device, as defined by Fourmentraux [Fourmentraux10]. The visitors explore the microscopic events that are
      performed in dense clusters of sound, sparse beeps and separated by long sequences of silence.</span></p>
  <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c0">micro | traces is a diptych, where we stage the dramatic slow down of two radically
      different moments of software. The first part of micro | traces is based on the recording of 1 second of a
      &nbsp;regular, consumer grade laptop that is not running any user application. In order to adapt this one second
      of a laptop doing nothing to human perception, it is necessary to magnify everything by a factor of 170 000. The
      second part of micro | traces is based on the recording of 1 second of the same laptop, while it is training a
      neural network (&lsquo;learning&rsquo;). This one second of a laptop learning is magnified by the same factor of
      170 000, turning the intense software into a dense long form sonic experience. The two parts of micro | traces are
      audiovisual projections of software that run for 47 hours each, contrasting a calm 1 second of a laptop doing
      nothing to a dense and sublime 1 second of a laptop in the process of learning.</span></p>

<h2 class="c6" id="h.saogirous47q"><span class="c13">Tell us more about the format and intended audience of your
      proposal</span></h2>
  <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c0">micro | traces is a long form audiovisual installation that unveils the inner life of
      the software core inside a computer. Most computer users, even advanced ones, only experience the graphical
      feedback that the operating system and applications choose to make available to them. With this installation we
      want to give the visitors a sense of the scale and magnitude of operations that are required for modern digital
      technology to function. The goal is not to educate about the technical details of the Linux kernel in particular
      or operating systems in general. Instead, we want to provide human perception experiential access to what is
      invisibly happening literally right under our fingertips, powering large parts of society.</span></p>
  <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The micro | traces installation is built on a foundation of data recorded in the
      software core of the computer: the kernel. The kernel can be thought of as the control centre of the computer. It
      communicates with all the peripherals, passes resources between different hardware and software components,
      optimises the usage of resources on the system, and decides when and for how long programs can run. It is the
      custodian, captain and administrator of the digital computer, and it is very fast.</span></p>
  <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Two closely related techniques were used to obtain a live recording of what happens at
      the kernel level: eBPF and ftrace. Using these techniques, we have run a wide sweeping recording for a single
      second on a normal laptop in two scenarios: idle and learning. When idle, the computer seemingly does nothing at
      all; no useful work is done for the benefit of the computer operator. When learning, the system is running the
      demanding and complex, if repetitive, task of training a deep neural network.</span></p>
  <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c0">During the installation, both traces are played back simultaneously on opposite sides
      of the room, alternating between solo passages and data duets. Each trace is presented in three ways:
      &nbsp;</span></p>
  <ul class="c10 lst-kix_r8mo7225jf3s-0 start">
    <li class="c1 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">sonically, projected into the room </span></li>
    <li class="c1 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">as a live graph showing the current progress, projected on the wall
        by the speakers, </span></li>
    <li class="c1 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">as a printed textual copy of all the events in human readable
        format, presented on bookstands. </span></li>
  </ul>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The projections on the walls also display some information such as when the next event
      will be played back, the number of events replayed so far, and on what page to read the next event, for those
      reading along. On the wall between the two traces will be a text providing some insight into the nature of the
      data. The room itself serves as a metaphor for entering a reconstruction of the software core of the
      computer.</span></p>
  <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The installation runs for 47 hours and 13 minutes in full. The duration can be adapted
      somewhat to fit the exhibition, or broken up into sessions.</span></p>
  <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The intended audience spans a wide range of curious digital citizens, from the tech
      savvys, to the lovers of minimalist electronic music and everyone who is interested in making sense of the digital
      world that is around us. The micro | traces installation is accessible to visitors of all ages. The installation
      operates on long time scales and the intention is that some visitors will take the time to appreciate the piece
      over time periods ranging from tens of seconds to tens of minutes. The sublimity of the software time and the
      dramatic slow down operated in micro | traces calls to the deep senses of immersive listening and patience.</span>
