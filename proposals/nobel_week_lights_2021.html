          <h3>Concept</h3>
          <p>For the Nobel Week Lights 2021, re|thread proposes a real time generative light work with software
            activity at the very core. Computer science is not a category for which Nobel Prizes are awarded. Meanwhile,
            <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00075-2">computers and software are the heart of the
              recent scientific
              breakthroughs</a>, which have been rewarded by Nobel prizes.
          </p>

          <p> At this early stage we propose two options for a software art installation at the Nobel Week Lights
            2021.
            These options, entitled <a href="#variant1">re|1</a> and <a href="#variant2">re|2</a>, share the same
            concept
            and are adapted to different locations. Common for
            both options is the desire to convey the <b>sublimity and texture</b> of core high frequency
            <b>software</b> operations
            using <b>laser projection</b> technology through fine grained <b>live generated visuals</b>.
          </p>

          <p>The term "laser projector" can have several meanings. What we mean for <a href="#variant1">re|1</a> and <a
              href="#variant2">re|2</a>
            is the type
            of fast
            scanning laser projector used for works such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9UQqTqGcHs">DEEP
              WEB by Christopher Bauder</a>, <a href="https://roberthenke.com/concerts/lumiere.html">Lumière</a> and <a
              href="https://roberthenke.com/installations/fragile_territories.html">Fragile Territories</a> by Robert
            Henke</a> or this <a href="https://vimeo.com/342449199">live performance by TUNDRA</a>.
            Images on the right are stills from these previous works using laser projection, which illustrate the kind
            of light we plan to use.</p>

        <div id="variant1" class="content">
          <h3>re|1: Interactive generative light projection installation</h3>

          <p>The first option allows for an interactive component to the work. It means that
            the audience must be able to come somehow close to the projection to read instructions for how to access the
            installation.</p>

          <p>The installation will have two modes. On one side, the installation will display the visitor's interaction.
            Secondly, the installation displays the software activity generated by the visitors actions.
            These two modes will ideally require two separate, possibly overlapping, projections.</p>

          <p>Interaction will made available through a web app in which visitors can choose among a range Nobel
            laureates. A short text that describes the discovery that earned them their
            prize will be shown. After selecting a laureate, their face will be projected on a wall.
            The visitor can then move their 'avatar' around the wall, through the app.</p>



          <h4>Software aspect</h4>
          <p>In the web app that we will develop, visitors can recreate a virtual meeting between past and present Nobel
            laureates. By picking their favourite Nobel prize winner and moving their photo around on a projection, the
            visitors will create an illusory mingle with some of the top scientists of all time.</p>
          <p>This, in one sense, rather simple interaction requires a lot of software to work. The software activity
            that we want to display through the light projections is the very software that runs the installation. To
            power the interactive element we will have a web server handle communication between the visitors'
            smartphones and the
            visual interface controlling the projections. This web server, while controlling this communication, will
            produce tons of software activity: millions of events every second. We will use the most relevant subset of
            this acitivty to feed a generative art algorithm, producing the laser movements that create the final light
            art projection.</p>


          <h4>Relation to Nobel</h4>

          <p>The installation will celebrate past and present Nobel laureates through the interactive part of the
            installations. Photos of the prize winners and a short and accessible description of their work will be
            integrated into the experience through a web interface.</p>

          <h4>Location</h4>

          <p>This option for the re|thread installation is well-suited for a projection on a wall, without windows and
            which
            the audience can approach easily. The following locations will work well:</p>

          <em>Kulturhuset, concrete wall on the back</em>
          <p>The back side of Kulturhuset has this wonderful industrial looking concrete wall:</p>
          <img src="../images/nobel2021proposal/Kulturhuset_wall.jpg" alt="" style="width: 100%" />
          <p>The flat wall and the lack of windows make it relatively easy to use this wall for laser projection. The
            location is very central and accessible. There are ample opportunities for placing projectors.</p>

          <em>Medborgarhuset, Medborgasplatsen</em>
          <img src="../images/nobel2021proposal/Medborgarhuset_July_2020.jpg" alt="" style="width: 100%" />
          <small>Photo: Arild Vågen</small>
          <p>Medborgarhuset has 3 front facing wall sections, each divided into two with windows in the middle. Either
            all three or the middle wall could be used. The windows would likely have to be covered to stop stray laser
            beams from reaching inside.</p>

        <div id="variant2" class="content">
          <h3>re|2: Real time generative light installation powered by science experiments</h3>
          <p>In the second option there is no interaction. Instead, the software activity that powers the generative
            art algorithm will be taken directly from computers running real, often very demanding, science experiments.
          </p>



          <p>Similar to the <a href="#variant1">option above</a>, the software activity will be fed into a generative
            algorithm that produces an
            abstract and fine-grained textural light installation through the use of several light projectors. Unlike
            it, however, this one will not have an interactive component. Meanwhile, this option will be performed at a
            larger scale, on
            iconic, full building facades, which must be observed from a distance to grasp the whole complexity of
            software and to appreciate
            the light installation in its entirety.</p>

          <h4>Software aspect</h4>
          <p>
            Software is necessary for modern scientific discoveries. The most recent breakthroughs in physics are
            evidenced through <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-72889-5">software simulations</a>,
            and all modern medicine and chemistry bleeding edge research is assessed
            through <a
              href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1931312820305151/pdfft?casa_token=vNLGQbnwyUgAAAAA:Gl2Z15G-8BbVY5FGJRbf06hAImUsGzVPIQAnkYoc_6bseQxapD89EcS2AK7i14s4hmZulWO74w&md5=730d8b88439a3fb7ea8475e2d777f671&pid=1-s2.0-S1931312820305151-main.pdf">advanced
              data analytics</a>.
            re|2 reveals the extraordinary complexity of the computational complexity that supports the scientific
            research of the latest Nobel prize laureates.
            For example, this installation unveils the rich interconnections between communities of mathematicians,
            software engineers and biologists that have build the software infrastructure for DNA data analysis,
            as well as the deep levels of code that allow Emmanuelle Charpentier to explore the mysteries of genomics.
          </p>

          <h4>Relation to Nobel</h4>
          <p>In a wide range of scientific fields, computers have become indispensable tools for carrying the research
            forward. They may be carrying out simulations of natural systems, analyze data from massive space
            telescopes, or <a href="https://foldingathome.org/diseases/infectious-diseases/covid-19/">help develop new
              treatments for serious diseases such as COVID-19</a>. This is true, also of the research done for present
            and future Nobel Prize laureates. By offering a window into this software realm, we unveil parts of the very
            foundation of tomorrow's great scientific discoveries.</p>

          <h4>Location</h4>
          <em>White buildings facing Hötorget</em>
          <img src="../images/nobel2021proposal/white_buildings_hötorget.jpg" alt="" style="width: 100%" />
          <p>This location is central, and it has huge white walls that would provide a good surface for laser
            projections. Mounting projectors should be easy if access to buildings facing the wall is possible.</p>
          <em>Katarinahuset, Slussen</em>
          <img src="../images/nobel2021proposal/Katarinahuset.JPG" alt="" style="width: 100%" />
          <p>Highly visible from far away. Mounting laser projectors may be possible on top of the pedestrian bridges.
          </p>
          <em>Bridge over Kungsgatan</em>
          <img src="../images/nobel2021proposal/Kungsgatans_bridge.jpg" alt="" style="width: 100%" />
          <p>Both a tunnel and a bridge, this prominent city feature embodies the metaphor of connection that is so
            pervasive for software at all levels.</p>

        <div id="tech" class="content">
          <h3>Tech</h3>
          <p>The location is the most important determining factor for exactly what equipment will be needed. The
            following diagram provides an overview of the setup we imagine:</p>
          <img src="../images/nobel2021proposal/Tech_blueprint5_with_overlay.jpg" alt="" style="width: 100%" />
          <h4>On site</h4>
          <p><b>Laser projector(s)</b> of sufficient brightness will need to be rented, as well as necessary housing for
            such a projector e.g. a container. 3 projectors
            will be required for ideal results, although we can make it work with fewer for some locations. An example
            of a suitable laser projector is the <a
              href="https://www.kvantlasers.sk/collections/kvant-atom-lasers/products/ld-33-atom-rgby">KVANT LD 33 Atom
              RGBY</a>.</p>
          <p><b>Laser DAC</b> to control the laser projector from a computer, such as the <a
              href="https://ether-dream.com/">Ether Dream 2</a> or the <a
              href="https://bitlasers.com/helios-laser-dac/">Helios Laser DAC</a>.</p>
          <p><b>Computer</b> generating the visuals and encoding them in the correct format for the projectors. Ideally,
            this computer will be placed inside a building with wired connectivity to the laser projectors.</p>
          <p><b>Stable and fast internet</b> to connect the installation to the web interface that
            the visitors can access. This will ideally be a wired connection to the computer inside a building (see
            above). Other solutions, such as a 4G mobile broadband connection, can be made to work, but will likely hurt
            the responsiveness of the interactive element.</p>
          <p><b>Power</b> for both the projectors and the computer controlling them.</p>
          <h4>Off site</h4>
          <p>A <b>web server</b> to connect the installation to its data source as well as provide the
            interactive experience in <a href="#variant1">re|1</a>.</p>
          <h4>Safety and security</h4>
          <p>Laser beams pointing directly towards people can in most cases be a safety hazard. To avoid this,
            precautions must be taken, both in the design of the piece and to make the laser projectors physically
            inaccessible to a curious audience. The projectors can be raised above human reachable height in a raised
            container, or by mounting them on/in a facing building if available.</p>
          <p>In the first option there is an interactive aspect to the work. This means that the projection has to be
            remotely controlled which opens it up to potential cybersecurity issues. We will therefore have to build
            fail safes into the code such that a malicious attacker cannot gain complete control of the projection or
            disable any safety features.</p>
