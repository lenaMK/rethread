          <h3>Concept</h3>
          <p>For the Nobel Week of Lights 2021, re|thread proposes a real time generative light work with software
            activity at the very core. While computer science is not a category for which Nobel Prizes are awarded,
            it is now one of the pillars on which much of the research of past and future Nobel laureats stands.</p>

          <p> At this early stage we propose two variants of the work which depend on what location we will be able to
            inhabit. Common for
            both variants is the desire to convey the <b>sublimity and texture</b> of core high frequency
            <b>software</b> operations
            using <b>laser projection</b> technology through fine grained <b>live generated visuals</b>.</p>

          <p>The term "laser projector" can have several meanings. What we mean when we say laser projector is the type
            of fast
            scanning laser projector used for works such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9UQqTqGcHs">DEEP

        <div id="variant1" class="content">
          <h3>Variant 1: Interactive generative light projection installation</h3>

          <p>The first variant depends on a location allowing for an interactive component to the work. This means that
            the audience must be able to come somewhat close to the projection to read instructions for how to access
            the installation.</p>

          <p>The installation will have two modes: one that displays the interaction by the visitors, another that
            displays the software activity generated by it. These two modes will ideally require two separate, although
            possibly overlapping, projections.</p>

          <p>Interaction will made available through a web app in which visitors can choose among a range Nobel
            laureates. Having chosen one, their face will be projected and moved around by the visitor. When choosing a
            Nobel laureate, a short text that describes the discovery that earned them their
            prize will be available.</p>

          <p>The software activity that we want to display is the very software that runs the installation. To power the
            interactive element we will have a web server handle communication between the visitors' smartphones and the
            visual interface controlling the projections. This web server, while controlling this communication, will
            produce tons of software activity: millions of events every second. We will use the most relevant subset of
            this acitivty to feed a generative art algorithm, producing the laser movements that create the final light
            art projection.</p>

          <h4>Location</h4>

          <p>For this variant of the installation, we think the following locations will work well:</p>

          <em>Kulturhuset, concrete wall on the back</em>
          <p>The back side of Kulturhuset has this wonderful industrial looking concrete wall:</p>
          <img src="../images/nobel2021proposal/Kulturhuset_wall.jpg" alt="" style="width: 100%" />
          <p>The flat wall and the lack of windows makes it relatively easy to use this wall for laser projection. The
            location is very central and accessible. There is ample opportunities for placing projectors.</p>

          <em>Medborgarhuset, Medborgasplatsen</em>
          <img src="../images/nobel2021proposal/Medborgarhuset_July_2020.jpg" alt="" style="width: 100%" />
          <small>Photo: Arild Vågen</small>
          <p>Medborgarhuset has 3 front facing wall sections, each divided into two with windows in the middle. Either
            all three or the middle wall could be used. The windows would likely have to be covered to stop stray laser
            beams from reaching inside.</p>

    <div class="inner alt">
      <section class="spotlight">
        <!-- <div class="image"><img src="images/request1.png" alt="" /></div> -->
        <div id="variant2" class="content">
          <h3>Variant 2: Real time generative light installation powered by real science experiments</h3>
          <p>In this second variant there is no interaction. Instead, the software activity that powers the generative
            art algorithm will be taken directly from computers running real, often very demanding, science experiments.
          </p>

          <p>In a wide range of scientific fields, computers have become absolutely indispensable tools for carrying the
            research forward. They may be carrying out simulations of natural systems, analyze data from massive space
            telescopes, or <a href="https://foldingathome.org/diseases/infectious-diseases/covid-19/">help develop new
              treatments for serious diseases such as COVID-19</a>.</p>

          <p>Similarly to variant 1, the software activity will be fed into a generative algorithm that produces an
            abstract and fine grained textural light installation through the use of several light projectors.</p>

          <h4>Location</h4>
          <em>White buildings facing Hötorget</em>
          <img src="../images/nobel2021proposal/white_buildings_hötorget.jpg" alt="" style="width: 100%" />
          <p>Centrally located huge white walls that would provide a good surface for laser projections. Mounting
            projectors should be easy if access to buildings facing the wall is possible.</p>
          <em>Katarinahuset, Slussen</em>
          <img src="../images/nobel2021proposal/Katarinahuset.JPG" alt="" style="width: 100%" />
          <p>Highly visible from far away. Mounting laser projectors may be possible on top of the pedestrian bridges.
          </p>
          <em>Bridge over Kungsgatan</em>
          <img src="../images/nobel2021proposal/Kungsgatans_bridge.jpg" alt="" style="width: 100%" />
          <p>Both a tunnel and a bridge, this prominent city feature embodies the metaphor of connection that is so
            pervasive for software at all levels.</p>

          <h3>Tech</h3>
          <p><b>Laser projector(s)</b> of sufficient brightness will need to be rented, as well as necessary housing for
            such a projector e.g. a container. Standard safety precautions need to be taken. 3 projectors
            will be required for ideal results, although we can make it work with fewer for some locations.</p>
          <p><b>Stable and fast internet</b> is needed to connect the installation to the web interface that
            the visitors can access.</p>
