          <h3>Concept</h3>
          <p>For the Nobel Week of Lights 2021, re|thread proposes a real time generative light work with software
            activity at the very core. While computer science is not a category for which Nobel Prizes are awarded,
            it is now one of the pillars on which much of the research of past and future Nobel laureates stands.</p>

          <p> At this early stage we propose two variants of the work which depend on what location we will be able to
            inhabit. Common for
            both variants is the desire to convey the <b>sublimity and texture</b> of core high frequency
            <b>software</b> operations
            using <b>laser projection</b> technology through fine grained <b>live generated visuals</b>.
          </p>

          <p>The term "laser projector" can have several meanings. What we mean is the type
            of fast
            scanning laser projector used for works such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9UQqTqGcHs">DEEP
              WEB by Christopher Bauder</a>, <a href="https://roberthenke.com/concerts/lumiere.html">Lumière</a> and <a
              href="https://roberthenke.com/installations/fragile_territories.html">Fragile Territories</a> by Robert
            Henke</a> or this <a href="https://vimeo.com/342449199">live performance by TUNDRA</a>.</p>

          <p>To the right are stills from inspiring works using laser projection.</p>

        <div id="variant1" class="content">
          <h3>re|1: Interactive generative light projection installation</h3>

          <p>The first variant depends on the location, allowing for an interactive component to the work. It means that
            the audience must be able to come somehow close to the projection to read instructions for how to access the
            installation.</p>

          <p>The installation will have two modes. Firstly, one display of the visitor's interaction. Secondly, the
            display of the software activity generated by it. These two modes will ideally require two separate,
            although possibly overlapping, projections.</p>

          <p>Interaction will made available through a web app in which visitors can choose among a range Nobel
            laureates. A short text that describes the discovery that earned them their
            prize will be shown. After selecting a laureate, their face will be projected on a wall and moved around by
            the
            visitor.</p>



          <h4>Software aspect</h4>
          <p>This, in one sense, rather simple interaction requires a lot of software to work. The software activity
            that we want to display through the light projections is the very software that runs the installation. To
            power the interactive element we will have a web server handle communication between the visitors'
            smartphones and the
            visual interface controlling the projections. This web server, while controlling this communication, will
            produce tons of software activity: millions of events every second. We will use the most relevant subset of
            this acitivty to feed a generative art algorithm, producing the laser movements that create the final light
            art projection.</p>


          <h4>Relation to Nobel</h4>

          <p>The installation will celebrate past and present Nobel laureates through the interactive part of the
            installations. Photos of the prize winners and a short and accessible description of their work will be
            integrated into the experience through a web interface.</p>

          <h4>Location</h4>

          <p>For this variant of the installation, we think the following locations will work well:</p>

          <em>Kulturhuset, concrete wall on the back</em>
          <p>The back side of Kulturhuset has this wonderful industrial looking concrete wall:</p>
          <img src="../images/nobel2021proposal/Kulturhuset_wall.jpg" alt="" style="width: 100%" />
          <p>The flat wall and the lack of windows make it relatively easy to use this wall for laser projection. The
            location is very central and accessible. There are ample opportunities for placing projectors.</p>

          <em>Medborgarhuset, Medborgasplatsen</em>
          <img src="../images/nobel2021proposal/Medborgarhuset_July_2020.jpg" alt="" style="width: 100%" />
          <small>Photo: Arild Vågen</small>
          <p>Medborgarhuset has 3 front facing wall sections, each divided into two with windows in the middle. Either
            all three or the middle wall could be used. The windows would likely have to be covered to stop stray laser
            beams from reaching inside.</p>

    <div class="inner alt">
      <section class="spotlight">
        <!-- <div class="image"><img src="images/request1.png" alt="" /></div> -->
        <div id="variant2" class="content">
          <h3>re|2: Real time generative light installation powered by science experiments</h3>
          <p>In the second variant there is no interaction. Instead, the software activity that powers the generative
            art algorithm will be taken directly from computers running real, often very demanding, science experiments.
          </p>



          <p>Similar to the <a href="#variant1">option above</a>, the software activity will be fed into a generative
            algorithm that produces an
            abstract and fine-grained textural light installation through the use of several light projectors. Unlike
            it, however, this one will not have an interactive component.</p>

          <h4>Software aspect</h4>
          <p></p>

          <h4>Relation to Nobel</h4>
          <p>In a wide range of scientific fields, computers have become indispensable tools for carrying the research
            forward. They may be carrying out simulations of natural systems, analyze data from massive space
            telescopes, or <a href="https://foldingathome.org/diseases/infectious-diseases/covid-19/">help develop new
              treatments for serious diseases such as COVID-19</a>. This is true, also of the research done for present
            and future Nobel Prize laureates. By offering a window into this software realm, we unveil parts of the very
            foundation of tomorrow's great scientific discoveries.</p>

          <h4>Location</h4>
          <em>White buildings facing Hötorget</em>
          <img src="../images/nobel2021proposal/white_buildings_hötorget.jpg" alt="" style="width: 100%" />
          <p>This location is central, and it has huge white walls that would provide a good surface for laser
            projections. Mounting projectors should be easy if access to buildings facing the wall is possible.</p>
          <em>Katarinahuset, Slussen</em>
          <img src="../images/nobel2021proposal/Katarinahuset.JPG" alt="" style="width: 100%" />
          <p>Highly visible from far away. Mounting laser projectors may be possible on top of the pedestrian bridges.
          </p>
          <em>Bridge over Kungsgatan</em>
          <img src="../images/nobel2021proposal/Kungsgatans_bridge.jpg" alt="" style="width: 100%" />
          <p>Both a tunnel and a bridge, this prominent city feature embodies the metaphor of connection that is so
            pervasive for software at all levels.</p>

            such a projector e.g. a container. Standard safety precautions need to be taken. 3 projectors
